# Differential Privacy

For a general introduction to differential privacy, check the
[top-level docs](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/blob/main/differential_privacy.md).

All of our algorithms inherit from the [`Algorithm`](algorithms/algorithm.md)
base class; you can find more details about the API there.

Here's a minimal example showing how to compute the count of some data:

```
#include "algorithms/count.h"

// Epsilon is a configurable parameter. A lower value means more privacy but
// less accuracy.
double count(const vector<double>& vals, double epsilon) {
  // Construct the Count object to run on double inputs.
  std::unique_pointer<differential_privacy::Count<double>> count =
     differential_privacy::Count<double>::Builder().SetEpsilon(epsilon)
                                                   .Build()
                                                   .ValueOrDie();

  // Compute the count and get the result.
  differential_privacy::Output result = count->Result(v.begin(), v.end());

  // GetValue can be used to extract the value from an Output (or Input)
  // protobuf. For count, this is always an int value.
  return differential_privacy::GetValue<int>(result);
}

```

## Caveats

All of our algorithms assume one input element per user. All of a user's
contributions should be reduced to a single input element before being passed to
our algorithms.
