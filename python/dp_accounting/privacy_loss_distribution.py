"""Implementing Privacy Loss Distribution.

This file implements the privacy loss distribution (PLD) and its basic
functionalities. The main feature of PLD is that it allows for accurate
computation of privacy parameters under composition. Please refer to the
supplementary material below for more details:

class PrivacyLossDistribution(object):
  """Class for privacy loss distributions and computation involving them.

  The privacy loss distribution (PLD) of two discrete distributions, the upper
  distribution mu_upper and the lower distribution mu_lower, is defined as a
  distribution on real numbers generated by first sampling an outcome o
  according to mu_upper and then outputting the privacy loss
  ln(mu_upper(o) / mu_lower(o)) where mu_lower(o) and mu_upper(o) are the
  probability masses of o in mu_lower and mu_upper respectively. This class
  allows one to create and manipulate privacy loss distributions.

  PLD allows one to (approximately) compute the epsilon-hockey stick divergence
  between mu_upper and mu_lower, which is defined as
  sum_{o} [mu_upper(o) - e^{epsilon} * mu_lower(o)]_+. This quantity in turn
  governs the parameter delta of (eps, delta)-differential privacy of the
  corresponding protocol. (See Observation 1 in the supplementary material.)

  The above definitions extend to continuous distributions. The PLD of two
  continuous distributions mu_upper and mu_lower is defined as a distribution on
  real numbers generated by first sampling an outcome o according to mu_upper
  and then outputting the privacy loss ln(f_{mu_upper}(o) / f_{mu_lower}(o))
  where f_{mu_lower}(o) and f_{mu_upper}(o) are the probability density
  functions at o in mu_lower and mu_upper respectively. Moreover, for continuous
  distributions the epsilon-hockey stick divergence is defined as
  integral [f_{mu_upper}(o) - e^{epsilon} * f_{mu_lower}(o)]_+ do.

  Attributes:
    value_discretization_interval: the interval length for which the values of
      the privacy loss distribution are discretized. In particular, the values
      are always integer multiples of value_discretization_interval.
    rounded_probability_mass_function: the probability mass function for the
      privacy loss distribution where each value is rounded to be an integer
      multiple of value_discretization_interval. To avoid floating point errors
      in the values, the keys here are the integer multipliers. For example,
      suppose that the probability mass function assigns mass of 0.1 to the
      value 2 * value_discretization_interval, then the dictionary will have
      (key: value) pair (2: 0.1).
    infinity_mass: The probability mass of mu_upper over all the outcomes that
      can occur only in mu_upper but not in mu_lower.(These outcomes result in
      privacy loss ln(mu_upper(o) / mu_lower(o)) of infinity.)
    pessimistic_estimate: whether the rounding is done in such a way that the
      resulting epsilon-hockey stick divergence computation gives an upper
      estimate to the real value.

    The Randomized Response over k buckets with noise parameter p takes in an
    input which is one of the k buckets. With probability 1 - p, it simply

    drawn uniformly at random from the k buckets.

    This function calculates the privacy loss distribution for the
    aforementioned Randomized Response with a given number of buckets, and a
    given noise parameter.

    Specifically, suppose that the original input is x and it is changed to x'.
    Recall that the privacy loss distribution of the Randomized Response
    mechanism is generated as follows: first pick o according to R(x), where
    R(x) denote the output distribution of the Randomized Response mechanism
    on input x. Then, the privacy loss is ln(Pr[R(x) = o] / Pr[R(x') = o]).

        ln(Pr[R(x) = x] / Pr[R(x') = x]). Here Pr[R(x) = x] = 1 - p + p / k

        ln(Pr[R(x') = x'] / Pr[R(x) = x']), which is just the negation of the
        previous privacy loss.
      - When o != x, x', the privacy loss is zero.

    Args:
