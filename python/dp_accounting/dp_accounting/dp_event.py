"""Standard DpEvent classes.

A `DpEvent` represents the (hyper)parameters of a differentially
private query, amplification mechanism, or composition, that are necessary
and sufficient for privacy accounting. Various independent implementations of DP
algorithms that are functionally equivalent from an accounting perspective may
correspond to the same `DpEvent`. Similarly, various independent implementations
of accounting algorithms may consume the same `DpEvent`.

All `DpEvents` processed together are assumed to take place on a single dataset
of records. `DpEvents` fall into roughly three categories:
 - `DpEvents` that release an output, and incur a privacy cost,
    e.g., `GaussianDpEvent`.
 - `DpEvents` that select a subset (or subsets) of the dataset, and run nested
    `DpEvents` on those subsets, e.g., `PoissonSampledDpEvent`.
 - `DpEvents` that represent (possibly sequentially) applying (multiple)
   mechanisms to the dataset (or currently active subset). Currently, this is
   only `ComposedDpEvent` and `SelfComposedDpEvent`.

Each `DpEvent` should completely document the mathematical behavior and
assumptions of the mechanism it represents so that the writer of an accountant
class can implement the accounting correctly without knowing any other
implementation details of the algorithm that produced it.

New mechanism types should be given a corresponding `DpEvent` class, although
not all accountants will be required to support them. In general,
`PrivacyAccountant` implementations are not required to be aware of all
`DpEvent` classes, but they should support the following basic events and handle
them appropriately: `NoOpDpEvent`, `NonPrivateDpEvent`, `ComposedDpEvent`, and
`SelfComposedDpEvent`. They should return `supports(event)` is False for
`UnsupportedDpEvent` or any other event type they have not been designed to
handle.

To ensure that a `PrivacyAccountant` does not accidentally start to return
incorrect results, the following should be enforced:
 * `DpEvent` classes and their parameters should never be removed, barring some
   extended, onerous deprecation process.
 * New parameters cannot be added to existing mechanisms unless they are
   optional. That is, old composed `DpEvent` objects that do not include them
   must remain valid.
 * The meaning of existing mechanisms or parameters must not change. That is,
   existing mechanisms should not have their implementations change in ways that
   alter their privacy properties; new `DpEvent` classes should be added
   instead.
 * `PrivacyAccountant` implementations are expected to return `supports(event)`
   is `False` when processing unknown mechanisms.
