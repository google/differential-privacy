# Differential privacy

Differential privacy offers a tradeoff between the accuracy of aggregations over
statistical databases (e.g. mean) and the chance of learning something about
individual records in the database. This tradeoff is an easily configured
parameter; you can increase privacy by decreasing the accuracy of your statistics
(or vice versa). Unlike other anonymization schemes (such as k-anonymity) that
completely fail once too much data is released, differential privacy degrades
slowly when more data is released.

You can find a very high-level, non-technical introduction to differential
privacy in this
[blog post](https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-awesomeness.html),
and a more detailed explanation of how it works in this
[longer article](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-02-06.md).

This library provides a collection of algorithms for computing differentially
private statistics over data. The algorithms are designed to require little
fancy mathematical knowledge to use; all the math is bundled into them.

# Key definitions
*A partition* is a subset of the data corresponding to a given value of the
aggregation criterion. Usually we want to aggregate each partition separately.
For example, if we count visits to restaurants, the visits for one particular
restaurant are a single partition, and the count of visits to that restaurant
would be the aggregate for that partition.

*A privacy unit* is an entity that we’re trying to protect with differential
privacy. Often, this refers to a single individual. An example of a more complex
privacy unit is a person+restaurant pair, which protects all visits by an
individual to a particular restaurant or, in other words, the fact that a
particular person visited any particular restaurant.

*Contribution bounding* is a process of limiting contributions by a single
individual (or an entity represented by a privacy key) to the output dataset
or it’s partition. This is key for DP algorithms, since protecting unbounded
contributions would require adding infinite noise.
