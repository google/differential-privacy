# This collection of test cases is intended to statistically evaluate the DP
# properties of the bounded mean aggregation provided by the DP library.

# The test cases and validation parameters are calibrated such that:
# - An approximate DP test accepts with a probability of at least 0.9 if the
#   distance between the two raw mean values is within the sensitivity.
# - An approximate DP test rejects with a probability of at least 0.9 if the
#   distances between the two data sets is at least 1.375 times the sensitivity
#   (both in the sum and the count of the elements) or if the failure rate is at
#   least the delta tolerance times 1.25.

  distance_specificity: 1.375

# Taking the majority vote over 9 repeated runs of a particular test case
# increases the accept and reject probabilities to 0.99911 or more.
